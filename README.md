This project focuses on designing the frontend of a Hotel Management System, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for hotel customers and staff. The system is built using modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap), and JavaScript (or React), offering a seamless and responsive experience across devices.

The frontend interface simulates real-world hotel operations by showcasing pages for room booking, customer registration, room availability, pricing, services, user login, and admin dashboard previews. Although this is a frontend-only project, it is structured to easily integrate with a backend in the future.
